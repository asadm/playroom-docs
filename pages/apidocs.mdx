# API Reference

## `insertCoin({ InitOptions })`

Tell Playroom to start! Playroom Kit will then handle room creation, players joining and also let players pick their names, colors and avatars. Once host taps "Launch", the promise resolves. At this point you can start your game.

```js
// Show Playroom UI, let it handle players joining etc and wait for host to tap "Launch"
await insertCoin();

// Start your game!
```

`InitOptions` is an object with the following properties:

| option       | type    | default | explanation                                                                 |
|--------------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `streamMode` | boolean | false   | If  `true` , Playroom will start in [ stream mode ]( /multiplayer/stream ). |
| `baseUrl`    | string  | *Current Page URL*      | The base URL used for generating room link that host shares with other players. |

## `getState(key: string): any`

Returns the current value of the given key in the game state.

```js
const winnerId = getState('winner');
```

## `setState(key: string, value: any, reliable: boolean = false): void`

Sets the value of the given key in the game state. If `reliable` is `true`, the state is synced reliably to all players via Websockets. This is useful for game state that is critical to the game, like the winner. 

If `reliable` is `false`, the state is synced via WebRTC, which is faster but less reliable. This is useful for game state that is not critical to the game, like the player's current position (you can always rely on next position update).

```js
setState('winner', 'player1');
```

## `onPlayerJoin(callback)`

Register a callback that will be called when a new player joins the room. The callback will be called with the player's [`PlayerState`](#playerstate) object.

If a new player joins after the game has started, the callback is called with all existing [`PlayerState`](#playerstate) objects, exclusively for the new player.

```js
onPlayerJoin((player) => {
  console.log(`${player.id} joined!`);
});
```

## isHost()

Returns `true` if the current player is the host.

```js
if (isHost()) {
  // Do something only the host should do, like reading player input and setting game state
}
```

## `isStreamScreen()`

Returns `true` if the current screen is the stream screen; a non-player screen that is shown when the game is in [ stream mode ]( /multiplayer/stream ).

```js
if (isStreamScreen()) {
  // Do something only the stream screen should do, like showing a countdown
}
```

## `myPlayer()` or `me()`

Returns the current player's [`PlayerState`](#playerstate) object.

```js
const player = myPlayer();
console.log(`Hello ${player.getProfile().name}!`);
```

## waitForState(stateKey: string): Promise&lt;any&gt;

Returns a promise that resolves to the state value only when the game state has the given key set, to any truthy value.

In other words, it waits until a game state is set. This is useful for waiting for the host to set the winner, for example.

```js
// Wait for the winner to be set
const winnerId = await waitForState('winner');
// Do something with the winner
```


## PlayerState

A `PlayerState` object represents a player in the room. It has the following methods:

### `getProfile(): PlayerProfile`

| `r`      | number | The red component of the color, between 0 and 255.                          |
| `g`      | number | The green component of the color, between 0 and 255.                        |
| `b`      | number | The blue component of the color, between 0 and 255.                         |

```js
const score = player.getState('score');
```

### `setState(key: string, value: any)`

Sets the value of the given key in the player's state.

```js
player.setState('score', 10);
```

### `onQuit(callback)`

Register a callback that will be called when the player quits the room.

```js
player.onQuit(() => {
  console.log(`${player.id} quit!`);
});
```

## Joystick Controller

### `Joystick(state: PlayerState, options: JoystickOptions)`

A component that renders a joystick controller. The joystick can be used to control the player's position in the game.

```js
import { Joystick, myPlayer } from 'playroomkit';

new Joystick(myPlayer, {
  type: "dpad"
})
```

`JoystickOptions` is an object with the following properties:

| option       | type    | default | explanation
|--------------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`       | string  | `angle` | The type of output joystick generates. Can be `dpad` or `angular`.          |
| `buttons`    | Array&lt;`ButtonOptions`&gt; | `[]` | An array of buttons to render on the joystick. See below for `ButtonOptions`. |
| `zones`      | `ZoneOptions` | `null` | An object to define custom zones on the 4 sides of the joystick. See below for `ZoneOptions`. |

`ButtonOptions` is an object with the following properties:

| option       | type    | default | explanation
|--------------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`         | string  | `null`  | The ID of the button. This is used to identify the button in the `isPressed` method. |

```js
if (joystick.isPressed('jump')) {
  // Jump!
}
```

### `isJoystickPressed(): boolean`
