# Bots in Playroom

Playroom lets you define bots for your game. These bots act the same as players; have player state, but can hold custom logic to act within the game loop.

Once you set up bots, players see a new ðŸ¤– + button which adds bots to their game room.

### Why Should I Use Bots?

Playing with friends is fun but you can't always have your friends around. Having bots in your game increases engagement and retention. Bots can fill empty rooms in your game, or provide a single player experience.
