# Bots in Playroom

Playroom lets you define bots for your game. These bots act the same as players; have player state, but can hold custom logic to act within the game loop.

Once you set up bots, players see a new `ðŸ¤– +` button which adds bots to their game room.

### Why Should I Use Bots?

Playing with friends is fun but you can't always have your friends around. Having bots in your game increases engagement and retention. Bots can fill empty rooms in your game, or provide a single player experience.

It's time to dive into the specifics. Choose the path that best suits your development needs:

**[Bot](/bots/bot)**: Explore the process of creating your own bot and integrating it to your game's unique mechanics.

**[DQN Bot](/bots/dqnbot)**: Explore the realm of reinforcement learning with our advanced Deep Q-Network bot that learns and makes smart decisions.
