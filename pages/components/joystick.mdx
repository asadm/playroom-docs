Playroom includes a customizable on-screen joystick controller that can be used by players as input.
It also supports additional buttons that can be used for actions such as jumping, shooting, etc.

Here is a usage example, check out the **[API Docs](/apidocs#joystick-controller)** for more details:

```js

import { insertCoin, myPlayer, onPlayerJoin, Joystick } from 'playroomkit';

// Start the game
await insertCoin();

let players = [];
// Create a joystick controller for each joining player
onPlayerJoin((state)=>{
  // Joystick will only create UI for current player (myPlayer)
  // For others, it will only sync their state
  const joystick = new Joystick(state, {
    type: "dpad",
    buttons: [
      {id: "jump", label: "Jump"}
    ]
  });
  players.push({state, joystick});
})

// In your game loop
players.forEach(({state, joystick})=>{
  // Update player position based on joystick state
  const dpad = joystick.dpad();
  if (dpad.x === "left"){
    // move player left
  }
  else if (dpad.x === "right"){
    // move player right
  }

  // Check if jump button is pressed
  if (joystick.isPressed("jump")){
    // jump
  }
});

```

### FAQs

#### I want angular value as 0-360 degrees

You can convert radians to degrees and then add 90 to get the value in degrees.

```js
function radToDeg(rad){
  return rad * 180 / Math.PI + 90;
}

console.log(radToDeg(joystick.angle()));
```

#### I want to convert angular value to X, Y components that go between -1 and 1

You can use `Math.cos` and `Math.sin` to get the X and Y components.

```js
function radToXY(rad){
  return {
    y: Math.cos(rad),
    x: Math.sin(rad)
  };
}

console.log(radToXY(joystick.angle()));
```
