# Mobile Multiplayer

When developing a game that enables players to join from their mobile devices, it is crucial to prioritize mobile integration. By selecting the mobile mode within our SDK, we can ensure consistent latency management across all devices. This means that every player will have a synchronized gaming experience, observing the game exactly as it is intended to be seen.
