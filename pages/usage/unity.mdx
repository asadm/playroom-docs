import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="🧪">
    The Unity SDK currently only supports **Unity Web.** This is an experimental technology.
</Callout>

Unity is the most popular game engine, it's also a great way to make web games thanks to the [WebGL export option](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-building.html). 

Playroom Kit complements Unity by simplifying the development of multiplayer games and interactive web-based applications.

Make sure to check out the Playroom Kit Unity SDK [Changelog](https://github.com/asadm/playroom-unity/releases) to get to know about anything new in the latest version! 

## Getting started

### Video Tutorial

<iframe style={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '80vw'}} width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1LXWZmJxlKA?si=nKZOaoiEj_WwXt6X" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<Steps>
### Install the SDK

1. Download `playroomkit.unitypackage` from the [releases page](https://github.com/asadm/playroom-unity/releases) (download `playroomkit.unitypackage` file).
2. Drag the package into your Unity project and import all files.
3. Open terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run:

```bash
cd Assets/PlayroomKit
npm install
```

This will install the required dependencies for the SDK.

### Initialize Playroom


<Tabs items={['>= v1.0.0 (latest)', 'Below 1.0.0']}>

  <Tab>

Initialize a PlayroomKit instance. We recommend initializing it in a Singleton and reusing it across your game.

Then, in your game's `Start` method, call [`InsertCoin`](/apidocs/unity#insertcoininitoptions-callback):

```csharp
using Playroom;

// ...
private PlayroomKit _playroomKit;
// ...

void Start() {
   // create a new instance before calling InsertCoin 
    _playroomKit = new();

    _playroomKit.InsertCoin(new InitOptions()
    {
        maxPlayersPerRoom = 2,
        defaultPlayerStates = new() {
            {"score", 0},
        },
    }, () => {
        // Game launch logic here
    });
}

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  
In your game's `Start` method, call [`PlayroomKit.InsertCoin`](/apidocs/unity#insertcoininitoptions-callback):

```csharp
using Playroom;

void Start() {
    PlayroomKit.InsertCoin(new PlayroomKit.InitOptions()
    {
        maxPlayersPerRoom = 2,
        defaultPlayerStates = new() {
            {"score", -500},
        },
    }, () =>
    {
        // Game launch logic here
    });
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


Now you can use Playroom throughout your game!

### Manage game state

PlayroomKit provides a robust state synchronization system through the [`PlayroomKit.SetState`](/apidocs/unity#setstatestring-key-t-value-bool-reliable--false-void) and [`PlayroomKit.GetState`](/apidocs/unity#getstatetstring-key-t) methods. These methods are used to handle game states and automatically sync with other players.

See the [API reference](/apidocs/unity) for more information.

### Export your game

To bring your game to the world, you must build! Configure your Build settings to our optimal settings.

1. Go to `File > Build Settings` and select `WebGL` as the platform.
2. In Player Settings:
   - Set `Resolution and Presentation > Run In Background` to `true`.
   - Choose your desired template (Choose **DiscordTemplate** if you want to publish to Discord Activities).
   - Set `Compression Format` to `None` under `Publishing Settings` (this is to make sure the build works with the [Playroom Portal](https://dev.joinplayroom.com)).
3. Build your game.
4. To test the build locally in your browser, run `python -m http.server` in the resultant build folder. We also recommend using [Servez](https://greggman.github.io/servez/), a simple web server solution with a nice interface. 

<br />
<Image src="/images/playroomkit-for-unity-unity-settings.png" width={800} height={700} />

Do note that **PlayroomKit for Unity** only works with WebGL builds.

</Steps>

## Updating from a previous version

Update PlayroomKit for Unity to get the latest features and fixes. We recommend doing the following:
1. Ensure your Unity version is above **2019 LTS**
2. Delete all `node_modules` folders from your previous installation
3. Add the latest plugin (See [Installation instructions](#1-install-the-sdk)). You **must** re-run `npm install` and get fresh packages.

## Examples

## Testing your games

PlayroomKit for Unity ships with some helpful features to make multiplayer game dev easier.

### Playroom Dev Manager

The PlayroomKit for Unity plugin includes a "Playroom Dev Manager" panel for multi-instance testing and ease-of-use, which controls two features:
1. [Mock Mode](#mock-mode)
2. [Multiple player testing](#multiple-player-testing)

![Playroom Dev Manager](/images/playroom-dev-manager.png)

#### Video Tutorial

<iframe style={{width: '100%', maxWidth: '80vw'}} height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zyYW7Q2ZI8?si=cSr5z-t0335GlOCy" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; muted" allowfullscreen autoPlay muted></iframe>


#### Getting started with the Playroom Dev Manager

PlayroomKit for Unity, when installed in your project, comes with a prefab called **PlayroomMockManager**. This is available inside the **PlayroomKit/Prefabs** folder.

Just **drag-and-drop** it into your scene. It should have two entries.

<br />
<Image src="/images/playroommockmanager.png" width={800} height={700} />

When you select **"PlayroomMockManager"**, you'll see the Playroom Dev Manager panel on the right. Here, you can:

1. Set the **Insert Coin Caller**. This is required for Playroom Dev Manager to work correctly. The "Insert Coin Caller" is simply the GameObject where InsertCoin is called in your game.
2. Choose your **Mock mode**. Learn more about it [here](#mock-mode).
3. Launch multiple players. This currently works best with Browser Bridge mock mode. More on it [here](#multiple-player-testing).

<br />
<Image src="/images/access-the-playroom-dev-manager.png" width={800} height={700} />



### Mock Mode

Since the current SDK only supports Unity Web, we've introduced **Mock mode** - a way to test out your game's logic in Unity's Preview mode, without having to build for web every single time.

#### 1. Local (simulated)
The "Local" mock mode doesn't connect to the actual Playroom servers. Instead, it just mocks the API calls within Unity, and maintains a local state.

**The "Local" Mock mode only works in single player mode for now.** We aim to make it multiplayer by Q4.

| **✅ Pros**                                                                 | **👎 Cons**                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Super fast                                                             | There may be inconsistencies                       |
| Not much setup, lightweight                                            | Can't benchmark network load/bandwidth             |
| Can work offline                                                       | Doesn't have multiplayer (yet), single-player only                                                    |
| No impact on Playroom bill                                             |                                                      |


#### 2. Browser Bridge (live)

<div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'start', gap: '0.3rem'}}>Status: <Badge style={{background: 'blue', color: 'white', width: 'fit-content', margin: '1rem 0'}}>Beta</Badge></div>

This mode connects to a live, multiplayer Playroom server **in the cloud**. It will make real network calls, but to do so, it will launch a controlled browser (to run the underlying network calls).

| **✅ Pros**                                                                 | **👎 Cons**                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Live on Playroom servers, testers can join in from live games                        | Takes time to set up                               |
| Completely accurate according to production                           | Network dependent (can't develop offline)          |
|                                                                          | It may eat up your Playroom bill                  |


##### Setting up the Browser Bridge mock mode

Follow these steps to set up **Browser Bridge mock mode** for your project. 

###### Step 1: Enable Browser Bridge Mock Mode  
1. In the **Playroom Dev Manager**, locate the "Mock mode" dropdown.
2. Select **"Browser Bridge (live)"** from the available options.

###### Step 2: Download and Set Up the Chrome Driver  
Browser Bridge mock mode requires a Chrome browser to run alongside the Unity Editor. You must install the appropriate ChromeDriver version matching your browser.

1. Identify your Chrome version.  
   - You can check this in your browser settings. Refer to [this guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads) for help.  
2. Download the corresponding ChromeDriver version from [Google's Chrome for Testing page](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable).  
3. Place the ChromeDriver in an accessible location on your machine.  

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Avoid adding the ChromeDriver to version control, as team members may use different browser versions. Each developer should maintain their own compatible version.
</Callout>

###### Step 3: Configure the Web Driver Path  
1. In the Unity project hierarchy, select **"UnityBrowserBridge"**.  
   
   <img src="/images/unitybrowserbridge.png" alt="Unity Browser Bridge Hierarchy" width="800" height="700" />  

2. In the "Inspector" panel on the right, locate **"Unity Browser Bridge (Script)"**.  
3. Update the **"Web Driver Directory"** field with the path to your ChromeDriver file.  

   <img src="/images/playroomkit-for-unity-chromedriver.png" alt="Updating ChromeDriver Path" width="800" height="700" />

###### Step 4: Update Paths for *nix Systems (if applicable)  
For macOS or Linux, update the **"Include JavaScript Files"** path in the "Element 0" field with the correct syntax for your system.  

<Callout type='info' emoji="ℹ️">
Different operating systems use different path separators. Ensure your paths are formatted correctly:  

- **Windows:** Use backslashes (`\`)  
  Example: `Playroomkit\modules\PlayroomMockBridge.js`  
- **macOS/Linux:** Use forward slashes (`/`)  
  Example: `Playroomkit/modules/PlayroomMockBridge.js`  
</Callout>

### Multiple Player testing 
<div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'start', gap: '0.3rem'}}>Status: <Badge style={{background: 'blue', color: 'white', width: 'fit-content', margin: '1rem 0'}}>Beta</Badge></div>

This currently works with **Browser Bridge mock mode** only.

To test with multiple players:

1. Ensure the latest version of the [PlayroomKit plugin](/usage/unity#1-install-the-sdk) is installed.
2. Open the [Playroom Dev Manager](#playroom-dev-manager) panel in Unity.
3. Click "Launch player" to create a new Unity Editor instance.
4. Repeat step 3 for additional player instances (limited by your computer's resources).

This feature uses [ParrelSync](https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync) Unity Editor to create multiple Unity Editor clones, each representing a different player.

<Callout emoji="🧠">
    **Tip:** Use this method to simulate various multiplayer scenarios and test synchronization between players without deploying your game.
</Callout>
 
By utilizing both Mock Modes and the Multiple Player testing feature, you can thoroughly test your game's multiplayer functionality and performance within the Unity environment before proceeding to a full WebGL build.

### PlayroomKit Console 

The `Playroom Console`, inspired by Valve's CSGO console, is a powerful Unity-based utility designed to accelerate multiplayer development with PlayroomKit. The console allows developers to rapidly `test`, `debug` and `implement` directly within the running game.

The PlayroomKit Console offers a comprehensive command set, enabling developers to interact with essential PlayroomKit API functions. This includes:
- **InsertCoin:** Facilitating game initialization and setup.
- **Player state management:** Modifying and inspecting player-specific data with commands like `PlayerGetProfile`, `PlayerSetProfile`, `WaitForPlayerState`, and `PlayerResetState`.
- **Matchmaking:** Simulating and testing matchmaking scenarios with commands like `RpcRegister` and `RpcCall`.
- **Event handling:** Triggering and observing game events with commands like `MyPlayer.Kick`, and `MyPlayer.Quit`.

Leveraging `PowerConsole`, a Unity-based runtime console for enhanced debugging, the PlayroomKit Console provides detailed, real-time logging of command execution and game state changes. This feature allows developers to Track the execution flow of commands, identify and diagnose issues promptly, and analyze game state transitions for debugging purposes.

The PlayroomKit console also allows developers to manage room configurations like retrieving room codes and customizing room settings.

## FAQ

<details>
  ### <summary>How to display player's profile picture in Unity?</summary>

  PlayroomPlayer.GetProfile().photo is formatted as `data:image/svg+xml,{svg encoded for url}`. In order to display it in Unity:
  - Remove `data:image/svg+xml` from the string.
  - Decode the rest using `HttpUtility.UrlDecode()`
  - Display the result into an `SVGImage` component.

  **Warning:** Requires Unity's Vector Graphics package from `com.unity.vectorgraphics`, which is an experimental package.

  ```csharp
   private void LoadSVG(string svgBytes) {
      // Split the string to escape the real data
      svgBytes = svgBytes.Split(",".ToCharArray(), 2)[1];
      // Decode from the URL encoding
      svgBytes = HttpUtility.UrlDecode(svgBytes);
      VectorUtils.TessellationOptions tesselationOptions = new VectorUtils.TessellationOptions();

      using (StringReader reader = new StringReader(svgBytes))
      {
          SVGParser.SceneInfo sceneInfo = SVGParser.ImportSVG(reader);
          tesselationOptions.MaxCordDeviation = float.MaxValue;
          tesselationOptions.MaxTanAngleDeviation = float.MaxValue;
          tesselationOptions.StepDistance = 1f;
          tesselationOptions.SamplingStepSize = 0.1f;

          List<VectorUtils.Geometry> geoms =
          VectorUtils.TessellateScene(sceneInfo.Scene, tesselationOptions);

          // Build a sprite with the tessellated geometry.
          Sprite sprite = VectorUtils.BuildSprite(geoms, 100.0f, VectorUtils.Alignment.Center, Vector2.zero, 128, true);
          sprite.name = "SVGimage";
          profilePicture.sprite = sprite;
      }
  }
  ```

  ### <summary>How to maintain an array of Players in Unity?</summary>

  You can manage a list of players in Unity to track their state and perform actions on them simultaneously. Here’s how to use [OnPlayerJoin](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/apidocs/unity#onplayerjoincallback) and [Player.OnQuit](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/apidocs/unity#onquitcallback):

  ```csharp
  object[] players = Array.Empty<object>();

  PlayroomKit.OnPlayerJoin((player) => {
    players.push(player);
    player.OnQuit(() => {
      Debug.Log($"{player.id} quit!");
      players = players.Where(p => p != player).ToArray();
    });
  });
  ```

  This is similar to the PlayroomKit JavaScript SDK's [usePlayersList hook](https://docs.joinplayroom.com/apidocs/react#useplayerslisttriggeronplayerstatechange-boolean).

  ### <summary>How to do physics over the network?</summary>

#### 1. Is it possible to achieve deterministic physics in Unity for networking?

Deterministic physics in Unity can be quite challenging to achieve due to the nature of the physics engines it uses. Unity uses **PhysX** for 3D physics and **Box2D** for 2D physics, both of which are deterministic by themselves. However, achieving determinism in a game involves more than just the physics engine being deterministic. For example, using the **Rigidbody** component in Unity has a property called **Interpolate** that affects how visuals are interpolated, which can cause differences between `transform.position` and `rigidbody.position`. This can lead to non-deterministic outcomes. For more details, you can check Unity's documentation on [Rigidbody interpolation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/rigidbody-interpolation.html).

#### 2. What are the conditions required for deterministic physics?

To achieve deterministic physics, all inputs (forces, impulses) must be applied to the same objects at the same time across all clients. Any delay in applying these inputs, even by one timestep, can lead to different results. This means that automatic updates of the physics engine in Unity should be disabled, and you should control these updates manually to ensure consistency. You can learn more about this in Unity's documentation on [Physics.Simulate](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics.Simulate.html) and the article on [Fix Your Timestep](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/) by Gaffer On Games.

#### 3. What is floating-point determinism, and why is it important?

Even if you manage to achieve deterministic physics in Unity, floating-point determinism is another hurdle. Different machines with different architectures may calculate floating-point numbers slightly differently, which can cause variations in physics simulations when networking. This can lead to desynchronization across clients. For more information, see the article on [Floating Point Determinism](https://gafferongames.com/post/floating_point_determinism/) by Gaffer On Games.

#### 4. What approach did the developers of Soccer Party use for networking physics?

Given the complexities of achieving deterministic physics, the developers of [Soccer Party](https://soccerparty.playroom.gg/#r=R) decided not to rely on it. Instead, they opted to frequently send position and velocity updates for rigid bodies, and even rotation data in some cases. Their focus shifted to optimizing the size and frequency of these messages rather than ensuring deterministic physics. This approach also requires solutions for handling synchronization issues, such as what to do when objects get out of sync, how to avoid these issues, and how to prevent players from noticing them.

These excerpts come from conversations with an active Discord member, **GuilhermeAlanJohann**.
