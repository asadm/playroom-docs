# Using React with Playroom Kit

React is a great way to build UIs and UI-based games. Playroom Kit makes it easy to build multiplayer games and apps for the web.

Playroom provides hooks for interacting with common Playroom states and player data. 

Here is a simple demo React app that uses Playroom Kit:

import Preview from '../../components/preview'

<Preview src="https://react1.playroom.gg" newWindow={true}/>
