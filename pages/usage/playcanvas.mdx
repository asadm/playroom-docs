# Using PlayCanvas with Playroom Kit

PlayCanvas is great for making web games as it uses web-native APIs under the hood. Playroom Kit complements PlayCanvas by simplifying the development of multiplayer games.

## Getting started

### 1. Add Playroom Kit as External Scripts
After you create a new project or open an existing one, go to the Settings and add the following URLs to the External Scripts list:

```
https://cdn.joinplayroom.com/playroomkit/multiplayer.full.umd.js
```

This will make `Playroom` global variable available in your project scripts.

### 2. Insert Coin

In any of the scripts where you want to initialize and use Playroom, add the following code at the top of the file:

```javascript
const { onPlayerJoin, insertCoin, isHost, myPlayer, getState, setState, Joystick } = Playroom;
```

### 3. Initialize Playroom

In the same script, call the `insertCoin()` method likely somewhere inside your `prototype.initialize` to start Playroom on page load.

#### Example
```javascript
const { onPlayerJoin, insertCoin, isHost, myPlayer, getState, setState, Joystick } = Playroom;
var GameManager = pc.createScript('gameManager');
GameManager.prototype.initialize = async function () {
  await insertCoin(); // Show Playroom lobby screen and wait for players to join
  // ... your game code
}
```

### 4. Follow rest of the [Multiplayer Steps](/multiplayer) to build your game in PlayCanvas.
The rest of the steps are the same as for any other web game. You can also use all of APIs including [On-screen Joystick](/multiplayer/joystick), [Gamepads](/multiplayer/gamepads), [Stream mode](/multiplayer/stream), etc.

### Sample Project

Here is a simple multiplayer example project that uses Playroom Kit with PlayCanvas.
