# PixiJS

[PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) is a fast and lightweight 2D WebGL graphics library with rich support for visual effects and interactive content.

Use the [Joystick](/multiplayer/joystick) to control ascii blobs in this simple, top-down demo!

### Code for the above demo
The multiplayer parts are highlighted so you can see Playroom in action! Find the full code [here](https://github.com/asadm/playroom-docs/blob/main/public/demos/pixijs1.html): 

```js {11,13,17,26-31,36,41-45,52,60-62,71,78}
import { onPlayerJoin, insertCoin, isHost, myPlayer, Joystick } from "playroomkit";
import { Application, Graphics } from "pixi.js";
import { AsciiFilter } from "@pixi/filter-ascii";

let players = [];
const playerSpeed = 2;

function start(app) {

  // 1. Handle players joining and quiting.
  onPlayerJoin((state) => {
    // create a joystick for the player
    const joystick = new Joystick(state, { type: "angular" });

    // create a circle sprite for the player
    const sprite = new Graphics();
    sprite.beginFill(state.getProfile().color.hex); // let's use the player's profile color
    sprite.drawCircle(0, 0, 64, 64);
    sprite.position.set(app.view.width / 2, app.view.height / 2);
    app.stage.addChild(sprite);
    
    // add the player's state with their joystick and sprite to the players array
    players.push({ state, joystick, sprite });
    
    // what should happen when the player leaves?
    state.onQuit(() => {
      // remove the sprite from the stage
      sprite.removeFromParent();
      // remove the player from the players array
      players = players.filter(player => player.state !== state);
    });
  });

  // 2. Let the host calculate everyone's state.
  app.ticker.add(() => {
    if (!isHost()) return; // only the host executes this block!

    // for each player in the game
    players.forEach(({ state, joystick, sprite }) => {
      // get their joystick direction in terms of x and y
      const isPressed = joystick.isJoystickPressed();
      const direction = { 
        x: isPressed ? Math.sin(joystick.angle()) : 0, 
        y: isPressed ? Math.cos(joystick.angle()) : 0
      }
      // calculate their new position
      const newPosition = { 
        x: sprite.x + direction.x * playerSpeed,
        y: sprite.y + direction.y * playerSpeed 
      }
      // update their position state
      state.setState("position", newPosition)
    });
  });

  // 3. Everyone updates their screen!
  app.ticker.add(() => {
    // for each player in the game, get position state and update their sprite
    players.forEach(({ state, joystick, sprite }) => {
      const newPosition = state.getState("position");
      // only update sprite if position state is available!
      if (newPosition) sprite.position.set(newPosition.x, newPosition.y);
    });

    // make sprites that are closer to the bottom of the screen appear in front
    app.stage.children.sort((a, b) => a.y - b.y);
  });
}

// 4. Insert Coin! Start the game.
insertCoin().then(() => {
  // create PixiJS app and attach to DOM
  const app = new Application({
    resizeTo: window
  });
  document.body.appendChild(app.view);
  // call our start function on the app
  start(app);
  // just for fun, let's apply a filter
  app.stage.filters = [new AsciiFilter(16)]
});

```
